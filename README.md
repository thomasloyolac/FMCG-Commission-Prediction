Problem statement:
This challenge is aimed at analysing different parameters of a Food and Beverage company.
The company tries to understand the interaction between various products, brands, outlets, 
commissions and their relationship to sales, revenue and marketshare. You may choose to use 
any open source analysis tool(s), and any statistical or machine learning algorithm(s) 
that you deem necessary for your analysis. The intent of this exercise is to get a firm understanding of
the contribution of commission payouts to overall sales and marketshare of each product, brand and company
through the use of effective exploratory data analysis, data visualization, predictive modeling and inference.

Perform an exploratory data analysis in understanding the sales of each product, brand and company 
and build a model for predicting the Commission for the respective sales.
